# 💸 Shark Tank India ML Project: Predicting Investment Success with AI 🚀

Thrilled to share insights from my recent machine learning project focused on Shark Tank India! This project leveraged AI to analyze entrepreneurial pitches, investor preferences, and deal dynamics from the show. Here’s a breakdown of what I accomplished:

## 📊 Project Overview:

- **Objective**: Predict investment outcomes, deal amounts, and analyze factors influencing deal success.
- **Dataset**: 117 pitches, 28 features including pitch amount, equity, investor presence, and deal values.

## 🔍 Key Use Cases & Solutions:

1. **Deal Success Prediction**:
   - Built a classification model to predict which pitches would successfully secure deals.
   - Achieved a 97% accuracy using Logistic Regression.

2. **Deal Amount Prediction**:
   - Developed a regression model to estimate deal amounts based on pitch data.
   - Minimized prediction error with Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 718.

3. **Clustering & Insights**:
   - Applied KMeans clustering to categorize pitches, aiding in better understanding of common pitch traits.

4. **Multi-label Classification**:
   - Predicted which specific sharks would invest using a Random Forest model with MultiOutputClassifier.
   - Enabled insight into shark-specific preferences.

5. **Valuation Estimation**:
   - Used Ridge Regression to estimate the pitch valuation, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 60,191.

## 📈 Results & Impact:

- Enhanced understanding of investor behavior on Shark Tank India.
- Created actionable insights into the factors that influence pitch success and deal values.
- Demonstrated how AI can be used to analyze and predict complex investment scenarios.

Excited to see how AI continues to transform the field of venture funding!
